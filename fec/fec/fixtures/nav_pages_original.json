Do you accept children, and, if so, at what point do children become members?</p>\n<p>5. How many members do you currently have? How long have they been members? How many members have you had in the past? What are the most you have had at one time? How many members do you intend to have? How long has the group been in existence?</p>\n<p>6.

How does the group deal with acts of physical and verbal violence?</p>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Community-In-Dialogue Status</h3>\n<p>If a community is seeking FEC membership but is not yet at the point where the Assembly will approve its application, that community may apply for Community-in-Dialogue (CID) status. For a community to be accepted as a CID, the Assembly need only be convinced that the community is actively working toward meeting the membership criteria, and that there exists a mutual desire for cooperation between the community and the FEC.</p>\n<p>The Assembly shall not be obliged to accept a community as a CID, even if it is working toward meeting the membership criteria, if it is felt that the community in question is actively contradicting those criteria (e.g., using violence, being governed by a leader or minority, discriminating on any of the grounds outlined in the Federation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s basic principles).</p>\n<h4>A Community-in-Dialogue shall:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Maintain an active relationship with at least one FEC community through activities such as visiting or labor exchange, written communication, attendance at conferences, etc.;</li>\n<li>Attend FEC assemblies if they so desire, and participate in discussions on a limited basis;</li>\n<li>Pay an annual base tax of $100, plus $5 per working member. This fee covers short listings in the FEC brochure, general administrative overhead, and other benefits that may be offered by the Assembly;</li>\n<li>Be eligible to participate in FEC projects specifically designated by the Assembly (e.g., conferences, training programs, etc.) on the same basis as members, but with the understanding that FEC members receive space priority. For some projects, if a CID wishes to participate, payment of a proportional tax equivalent to the share paid by a member community may be required; and</li>\n<li>Have their status reviewed annually by the Assembly.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>A Community-in-Dialogue shall not:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Vote upon or ratify decisions of the Assembly; or</li>\n<li>Be eligible for transportation subsidies.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 align=\"center\">Community in Dialogue to Full FEC Membership</h2>\n<p>by Ethan Tupelo</p>\n<h4 align=\"center\">Background</h4>\n<p>The intent of this document is to create standing guidelines of specific criteria FEC delegates should look for in current CID communities to become full members of the FEC.</p>\n<p>We already have guidelines on how a community interested in the FEC can get CID status. CID status essentially has been the category we hold interested communities in while they are working to meet all the criteria for full membership. There is no fixed limit on the amount of time a community can have CID status; presumably, as long as the delegates see no reason to revoke that status, they can be CID as long as it takes until they can be accepted as full members.</p>\n<h4 align=\"center\">Constitutional Requirements</h4>\n<p>The only guidelines the FEC Constitution gives about new communities joining is that they must meet the seven core principles of the FEC. The decision is made through normal decision making structure we establish for all our decisions. In practice we have been making decisions entirely by consensus in recent years, as the Constitution suggests we always strive to do. However, in the event that we can\u2019t reach consensus, there is the option of using the fallback weighted voting method based on population. If this method is used, ? of the weighted votes cast are needed to admit a new community to the FEC.</p>\n<p>For good measure, the FEC Constitution states that:</p>\n<p>\u201cA necessary condition for membership will be that the prospective community, in the judgment of the Assembly, meets the following basic requirements:</p>\n<p>1. Holds its land, labor, and other resources in common;</p>\n<p>2. Assumes responsibility for the needs of its members, receiving the products of their labor and distributing these and all other goods equally or according to need;</p>\n<p>3. Practices non-violence;</p>\n<p>4. Uses a form of decision-making in which members have an equal opportunity to participate, either through consensus, direct vote, or right of appeal or overrule;</p>\n<p>5. Actively works to establish the equality of all people and does not permit discrimination on the basis of race, class, creed, ethnic origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity;</p>\n<p>6. Acts to conserve natural resources for present and future generations while striving to continually improve ecological awareness and practice;</p>\n<p>7. Creates processes for group communication and participation and provides an environment which supports people's development.\u201d</p>\n<p>and:</p>\n<p>\u201cA majority greater than 1/2 of the votes cast is necessary for decisions to be made, except for proposed amendments to this constitution, accepting communities into the Federation, and expelling communities from the Federation, all of which require at least 3/5 of the votes cast.\u201d</p>\n<h4 align=\"center\">Specific Criteria</h4>\n<p>(The following can only be viewed as a guide for what we are looking for, as many of these points are going to come down to judgement calls made by the delegates about specific situations that we can\u2019t anticipate.)</p>\n<p>Communities desiring full membership in the FEC should:</p>\n<p>1. Be a Community in Dialogue for at least one year, and meet the requirements for communities in that category, such as attending Assemblies, participating in FEC discussions, having at least one site visit, etc.</p>\n<p>2. Have the seven FEC principles as core values of the community in their Bylaws (or equivalent fundamental documents). This does not have to be a word for word copy (it may actually be preferable for communities to put the core principles into their own words so they are relevant to their own situation), but the community should be able to demonstrate that those principles are part of the community\u2019s written core values.</p>\n<p>3. Be actually following the above seven principles. As in, to the best of our ability to determine, make sure that the community hasn\u2019t just put these nice sounding words on paper when they\u2019re actually doing something different in practice. This is usually what we\u2019re looking for when we do site visits and have other conversations with members.</p>\n<p>4. Have group ownership of all land, property, and other major resources. This can be accomplished by having the owner of those resources be the community as a corporation, and having all full members of the community being members of the corporation; by adding full members onto a legal joint ownership document; or some other equivalent. One member, or a small group of the members, having ownership of these major resources is not acceptable, as those people can wield undue influence over the community as long as they retain ownership. The delegates can consider admitting communities that have multi-year plans for ownership transition, but those agreements should be legally binding. \u201cOwnership\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the community must completely own their own land or property, but instead refers to the relevant legal arrangement for group versus individual control of the land. For example, it is acceptable for the community to be paying off a 30 year mortgage on their property to a bank (it doesn\u2019t have to be completely paid off for them to join the FEC), but these situations should still be done as a collective, not only a few individuals.</p>\n<p>5. Have a detailed income-sharing model in place, preferably already functioning for some time before applying for full membership.</p>\n<p>6. Appear to be sufficiently stable, in terms of population, economics, and other relevant factors. While all communities go through such fluctuations on a regular basis, we want to be fairly certain that the community is not going to disappear within a year or so, which is especially common with new communities. If it appears that is the case, the community should remain at CID status, and the FEC should do whatever it can to help create the necessary stability.</p>\n<p>7. Have, at minimum, three members, none of whom are in a romantic relationship or family. We\u2019ve had communities in the past apply for FEC membership that no one else seemed to want to join, mostly because there was a dynamic of one family essentially having control over the community, and occasionally a few other people living there for a few months. Preferably, the population of a new community would be closer to at least six people when applying for FEC membership, which is usually enough to counteract a lot of this dynamic, even if there is a family unit in that small group.</p>\n<p>8. Not have different tiers or levels of membership, or significantly different privileges based on membership length, beyond the provisional to full member process. Once people are full members, they should have the same basic level of political and economic equality.</p>\n<p>9. Not have any blanket restrictions on people joining based on sex, gender, age, race, sexual orientation, gender identity, and other similar discriminatory categories. For example, we have in the past rejected communities that were explicitly only one gender. While things like this may be controversial, it is our current standing decision. Policies that establish certain demographic quotas are acceptable (for example, the limits many of our communities have on overall gender balance, or average age).</p>\n<p>10. Have systems in place to provide for the health and medical needs of all its members up to at least the requirements of PEACH. Since FEC membership guarantees automatic membership in PEACH, and since one of the presumptions of PEACH is that member communities are taking care of the health needs of its members up to the catastrophic level where PEACH kicks in, this is something we need to evaluate.</p>\n<p>11. Be able to address a variety of less tangible factors that the delegates believe are necessary. There are likely going to be many situations where a community seems to be in a somewhat borderline situation with some of the above criteria, or there may be issues about things that we can\u2019t think of in advance.</p>\n</div>"}}, {"pk": 12, "model": "pages.richtextpage", "fields": {"content": "<p><span><i> So you want to start an Egalitarian Community...</i></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://thefec.org/files/images/BeechsideFamilyPortrait.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Beechside Members at Twin Oaks\" height=\"112\" align=\"right\" width=\"150\">Welcome to the Community Creation information Packet by the Federation of Egalitarian Communities.</p>\n<p>This page is a compilation of articles on Community Creation.

Your core group will consist of the people who will take on tasks and do them. Your core group will be the people that see the project through.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The following sections will help to explain how to find people to form your core group, and important things for your core group to try to accomplish.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>Funding</h3>\n<p>How will you and your future communards fund your communities creation? This section deals with the issues of funding.</p>\n<p>Starting up a community can require a significant amount of capital. Many communities are started by the founding members pooling their existing assets into the new common treasury. This will probably be one of your main sources of funds. There are also several resources we suggest exploring for funding sources:</p>\n<p></p>\n<h4>Contact the FEC</h4>\n<p>The FEC has recently started a expansion fund that will be used to loan money for communities in the formation stages. <a href=\"mailto:secretary@thefec.org\">Click here to contact the FEC</a></p>\n<h4>PEACH</h4>\n<p>PEACH is a collective catastrophic health insurance program started by the FEC for income-sharing communities. The health fund increases its capital by making loans for projects that are consistent with the overall goals of the member communities. One of these areas has been helping to fund new communities, although loans are not limited to this purpose. <a href=\"mailto:tom@twinoaks.org\">Click here to contact PEACH</a></p>\n<h4>EGFS Social Justice Fund</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://thefec.org/EGFS\">Emma Goldman's Finishing School</a>, one of the FEC communities, has a social justice fund which is primarily used to help start new communities near them in the Seattle area. If you are thinking of starting a community in that area, <a href=\"mailto:egfs@riseup.net\">contact EGFS</a>.</p>\n<h4>FIC Community Magazine</h4>\n<p>While not specifically focused on egalitarian communities, the Foundation for Intentional Communities puts out a quarterly magazine called Communities. There are often many advertisements for funding in each issue. The magazine is also a place where one can publish ads requesting additional types of support and see other similar requests and offers, as well as being an excellent source of information about communities in general. <a href=\"http://communities.ic.org/\">Click here to visit the Communities magazine website</a>.</p>\n<h4>Local/Project Specific Grants</h4>\n<p>Depending on where your community is located, there are often local sources of funding offered by local and state governments, or other various non-profit or non-governmental agencies. Many of these sources of funding are also specific project based. For example, some of the communities in Missouri were able to have the state's department of agriculture fund most of the cost ofredredging some of their ponds which were necessary for their farming. Urban communities with more of an outreach focus may be able to receive funding or partner with various other organizations to accomplish common goals. Since most of these sources of funding are location based and extremely numerous they won't be listed here. However, it is worth keeping in mind that funding may be found in some amount from organizations that are not community focused, and a search of these sources should not be overlooked.</p>\n<h3>Resources</h3>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<h4>PRINT RESOURCES:</h4>\n<p>The Communities Directory and Communities Magazine are both published by the Fellowship for Intentional Community, and contain a wealth of information that is useful for forming communities.

One of their primary missions is to distribute information about community building. Their main website is <a title=\"www.ic.org\" href=\"http://www.ic.org\">www.ic.org</a>.</p>\n<p>The Federation of Egalitarian Communities: this webpage features a \"Systems and Structures\" section, which is a compilation of policies from various income-sharing communities. They are freely available for people to peruse and use as they see fit, either modifying them to suit your group, or using them as a springboard for forming your own. Systems and Structures can be accessed from the FEC homepage <a title=\"www.thefec.org\" href=\"http://www.thefec.org\">www.thefec.org</a> or directly at <a title=\"http://thefec.org/sns\" href=\"http://thefec.org/sns\">http://thefec.org/sns</a>.</p>\n<p>The Northwest Intentional Communities Association (NICA) is a community networking group for the NorthWest US.

These policies are specific toTwin Oaks but could be modified or used as a starting framework for new groups. <a title=\"www.twinoaks.org\" href=\"http://www.twinoaks.org\">www.twinoaks.org</a></p>\n<h4>REAL LIFE RESOURCES:</h4>\n<p>For forming groups, it is extremely useful to visit real life communities, including ones that are very different from your vision. Finding out how other groups organize themselves provides an enormous amount of information as a starting point, and can be very helpful in clarifying for yourselves how you do or don't want to do things. I encourage you to visit as many communities as you can. (it's often easier to do this in your geographic region, as it requires a lower investment of time and travel money). The FIC's webpage <a title=\"http://directory.ic.org\" href=\"http://directory.ic.org\">http://directory.ic.org</a> includes a list of cmties, and you can search geographically, so you'd be able to find ones in the area you're interested in. (go to the \"List of....\" link and click \"geographic search\").</p>\n<h4>Conferences:</h4>\n<p>Twin Oaks hosts an annual Communities Conference which offers workshops on various aspects of living cooperatively (decison- making, interpersonal skills, etc.). The conference is a wonderful resource for meeting both other seekers who may want to join your effort, as well as experienced communitarians who have insights and skills to offer. For more information, please visit <a title=\"http://www.communitiesconference.org\" href=\"http://www.communitiesconference.org\">http://www.communitiesconference.org</a> or call 540-894-5126.</p>\n<p>The FIC periodically hosts The Art of Commity weekend conferences. You can find out more at .</p>\n<p>You might also want to consider doing a Three-Week Visitor Program at Twin Oaks (<a title=\"http://www.twinoaks.org\" href=\"http://www.twinoaks.org\">http://www.twinoaks.org</a> \"Visitor Program\" link) to learn how we structure ourselves. (bearing in mind that we are income-sharing, which may be different from your set-up, and still useful). Our Visitor Program is quite structured and offers orientations on various aspects of how we structure and organize ourselves--communal decision-making and self-governance, group health care, our legal structure and policies, child-raising, and more. If you're in our area sometime, you may want to come for a Saturday tour (see our webpage for more details).</p>\n<p>The Occidental Arts and Ecology Center in California offers a course: Starting and Sustaining Intentional Communities Course:</p>\n<p>Do you dream of establishing a land-based intentional community or education center?
